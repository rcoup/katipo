If you are reading this page, then your website has likely been touched by a user of the Katipo web crawler.  We have included some information below to help you understand what's going on.

**The Katipo project is _NOT_ crawling your site. We provide a software tool for people to use on their own, and they can point it where they like. So we can't stop it from crawling your site, no matter how much you ask/plead/threaten.**

## About Katipo ##

[Katipo](http://katipo.googlecode.com/) crawls a user's site to test their web application, and is by default configured to test external links. So if a user is testing their website at http://example.com/ and there is a link to http://yoursite.com/something/, then that URL will be crawled by Katipo. No further URLs from http://yoursite.com/ will be requested.

## You don't support `robots.txt`! ##

No, we don't at the moment. But it's coming real soon: both blocks and crawl-rate obedience.

## How do I contact the person pointing Katipo at me? ##

We'll be adding an email address into the user-agent string shortly, so you can contact the user.
